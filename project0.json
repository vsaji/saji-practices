I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request your assistance in raising a job requisition to backfill Ken's position, as he has resigned and will be leaving the firm by the end of August 2024.

From the Engineering and Architecture Team's perspective, it is crucial to fill this position promptly. The team is expanding our telemetry and visualization platform to support multiple applications across the FFD Cash organization. Ken was the sole resource managing the UX development for the GFF platform, and his departure will significantly impact our ability to deliver on multiple critical tasks related to telemetry and FFG.

Given the team's already lean structure, an immediate backfill is essential to maintain our project timelines and deliverables.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
