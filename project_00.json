The TTD platform provides a unified data injection interface for OpenTelemetry metrics and traces generated by Ambrosia/TRON and SPRING Boot applications. Metrics data is stored in S3 using Cortex, while trace data is captured via Grafana TEMPO and also stored in S3. The retention period is 7 days for traces and 30 days for metrics. TTD offers a telemetry API for non-Ambrosia applications to export trace data without relying on the OpenTelemetry SDK. This API collects trace data from the client's service with minimal latency, exports it to the TTD platform, and converts it to the OpenTelemetry-specific format before publishing it to Grafana Tempo.
