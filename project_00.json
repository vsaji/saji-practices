The TTD platform provides a unified data injection interface for OpenTelemetry metrics and traces generated by Ambrosia/TRON and SPRING Boot applications. Metrics data is stored in S3 using Cortex, while trace data is captured via Grafana TEMPO and also stored in S3. The retention period is 7 days for traces and 30 days for metrics. TTD offers a telemetry API for non-Ambrosia applications to export trace data without relying on the OpenTelemetry SDK. This API collects trace data from the client's service with minimal latency, exports it to the TTD platform, and converts it to the OpenTelemetry-specific format before publishing it to Grafana Tempo.

Good morning. I hope this message finds you well. This is Jan from EQ CASH MO Organization, reporting to UU Brady, previously with PP Kumar.

Recently, I had a discussion with EE Warden regarding my next career move, which I would like to align more with the Technology and Engineering sectors. He suggested that I reach out to you, as he believes there may be upcoming opportunities in the TTS space.

If it is convenient for you, could we schedule a 15-minute call tomorrow or at another available time this week?

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I was tasked with building a telemetry visualization platform for the EQ Cash organization, which provides a centralized data injection interface for OpenTelemetry metrics and traces generated from Ambrosia, TRON, and SPRING boot applications. The platform uses Cortex and Tempo for data capture and S3 for storage. It offers endpoints for clients to export Prometheus metrics and trace data from their services. The platform also includes a Grafana component pre-configured with all necessary data sources for the applications. Additionally, I created a telemetry API for non-Ambrosia applications to export trace data without relying on the OpenTelemetry SDK. This API efficiently collects trace data from the client's service, exports it to the platform, converts it to the OpenTelemetry format, and publishes it to Grafana Temp.


Boosting TRON Framework Adoption in ICG to Reduce Time-to-Market

TRON is equipped with features that allow developers to concentrate on building services from a business perspective, leaving technical integrations, monitoring, and other non-functional requirements to TRON. This significantly reduces the time the team spends on solution development, as most common and critical functionalities are already pre-built and pre-configured in TRON.
