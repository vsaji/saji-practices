Ambrosia Telemetry Integration
Led the integration of Ambrosia's telemetry tracing component into RTCS 2.0 services, becoming the first application to leverage this offering.
Spearheaded the end-to-end integration, customizing the OTEL publisher to capture and report RTCS IDs.
Collaborated closely with the Ambrosia team to ensure timely delivery of defect fixes and enhancements.
Supported the RTCS team in extending the solution across additional service instances.
The solution went live on October 11, enabling the team to visualize request flow and latency through the Tron Grafana dashboard.
TRON Telemetry Platform
Established a fully managed telemetry platform to support multi-tenant environments.
The platform is backed by S3 object storage, featuring self-managing data retention policies activated in Cortex and Tempo DB.
It includes a dashboard that allows TRON clients to visualize infrastructure metrics without the need for setup.
Tenants from EQ MO and Principal Internalizer teams are currently using the platform.
Besides metrics visualization, RTCS and PI teams benefit from the platform's distributed tracing capabilities.
Implemented LDAP-based access control to standardize user entitlements across the platform.
