Ambrosia Telemetry Integration
Led the integration of Ambrosia's telemetry tracing component into RTCS 2.0 services, becoming the first application to leverage this offering.
Spearheaded the end-to-end integration, customizing the OTEL publisher to capture and report RTCS IDs.
Collaborated closely with the Ambrosia team to ensure timely delivery of defect fixes and enhancements.
Supported the RTCS team in extending the solution across additional service instances.
The solution went live on October 11, enabling the team to visualize request flow and latency through the Tron Grafana dashboard.
TRON Telemetry Platform
Established a fully managed telemetry platform to support multi-tenant environments.
The platform is backed by S3 object storage, featuring self-managing data retention policies activated in Cortex and Tempo DB.
It includes a dashboard that allows TRON clients to visualize infrastructure metrics without the need for setup.
Tenants from EQ MO and Principal Internalizer teams are currently using the platform.
Besides metrics visualization, RTCS and PI teams benefit from the platform's distributed tracing capabilities.
Implemented LDAP-based access control to standardize user entitlements across the platform.

CGMI Billing Re-engineering
Provided comprehensive guidance in rearchitecting the CGMI Billing services.
Accelerated design and development by leveraging the Tron Stack solutions.
Assisted with ECS procurement and building job services using Tron-Job Agent and Tron-Job Server.
The team successfully built and deployed their services within two months of project initiation.
TRON Key Highlights
Created vanity URLs for all client-facing services, including Cortex, Tempo, REST API, Grafana, and TronSB.
Introduced a new TRON-ITRS centralized/deployable component to replace existing application-owned ITRS components.
The Thailand-Split project is being redesigned to use the TRON framework for further development of microservices.
Successfully tested Ambrosia REST service integration with the TRON dashboard without requiring changes to the existing service.
Developed a self-service endpoint to facilitate the migration from OpenShift DeploymentConfig to Deployment.

E3 Training

I had the privilege of participating in E3 2024, a prestigious and highly selective annual training program organized by XS, with only a limited number of seats available each year.
My group secured 2nd place for our compelling project presentation, where I played a key role in its success.
The project focused on implementing DORA metrics, and we were tasked with delivering a trunk-based development tracker.
The solution will be integrated into the EE capability dashboard to monitor the level of trunk-based development adopted by a CSI.
We utilized the Helix Platform for testing and employed technologies such as Python, GraphQL, and OpenShift to develop the solution.
This training not only enhanced my technical expertise but also provided valuable insights into managerial and soft skills that are crucial in the workplace.
