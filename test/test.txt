Hi Raj,

Good morning. My profile already includes project experience and business deliverables related to asset classes, though I’ve recently focused more on engineering tasks across EQ MO.
I also wanted to ask for your advice – do you recommend that I formally apply for this role via WD to increase my chances of getting shortlisted?

Thank you for your guidance.
