I have a solid background in managing and delivering projects for EQ MO/FO, covering asset classes like Fixed Income, Cash, and Derivatives (Rates, Swaps, and Options). With extensive knowledge of the trade lifecycle gained from my experience with front-office and middle-office organizations at Credit Suisse and Citi, I am confident in my ability to lead and deliver projects from a technology perspective, grounded in strong engineering principles.
