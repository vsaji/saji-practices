Hi Raj,

Good morning. I came across a role under your leadership and wanted to check if it’s still open for applications. If the position is still accepting profiles, I would be very interested in exploring this opportunity. Currently, I lead the Engineering & Architecture space in the EQ MO CASH area and report to Scot Brady, who reports to KK.

Here’s a brief elevator pitch about me:

    Singapore PR – No sponsorship required
    Total Experience: 21 years, with 18 years in banking and 13 years at Citi
    Extensive experience across technology and infrastructure stacks
    Author/Product Owner of the TRON Stack Platform
    Representing E&A MBR for Peter J since June 2024
    Hands-on technologist, low-latency developer, and engineering lead
    Current reporting structure: Scot -> KK -> Peter J

Looking forward to hearing from you.
