As discussed, please proceed with rolling out the offer to Genny for the VP position. If she accepts, we should aim to onboard her within two weeks. Please keep us updated on the outcome.

Gine mentioned that Dave's role will be hired in Canada. As you know, we have been interviewing candidates for the RTCS/Architecture role. During this process, we have identified a few candidates who we believe would be a great fit for the App Lead position.

Attached is the profile of one such candidate for your review. Once the job is posted in Workday, please proceed with discussions with this candidate.

Let me know if you need any additional information.


The solution includes a feature-rich dashboard built with ReactJS, seamlessly integrated with the CitiVelocity platform and a comprehensive Grafana setup powered by CORTEX, TEMPO, and S3. It enables real-time monitoring of microservices deployed across various clusters and allows remote diagnostics of microservices through pre-built endpoints.

The candidate struggled to provide clear and satisfactory answers to the questions, including explaining project details or the rationale behind specific design and implementation choices. Despite the questions being based on the candidate's CV, she was unable to effectively articulate the concepts or skills listed. Java and microservices expertise appeared to be weak. Therefore, we are unable to move forward with this candidate.


Do we know who can approve this job requisition from the CCMP team? Please assist in expediting the process, as we’ve observed that most requisitions are being force-closed.

Hi Rthh,

I came across the email below from the TGG team, instructing users to migrate deployment descriptors from DeploymentConfig to Deployment. As you may recall from our previous meeting, the MO E&A team has developed an automated solution for this migration using a simple curl command.

I have CC’d you in the announcement email I sent in September 2024, and I’ve attached it here for reference. Could you please review it and help promote this solution among your users to ensure broader adoption?

Thanks!


Hi Dswwi,

I wanted to address my concerns directly with you regarding the way our recruitment process is progressing. I spoke with you yesterday to highlight this in a softer tone, but I feel the need to reiterate my points clearly.

As a hiring manager, getting a position opened and fully approved is a challenging process. Once the requisition is listed, our expectation is to close it within two weeks. Given that our requirement is fairly standard, we should be seeing a steady flow of relevant profiles. A recruiter’s role is critical in streamlining this process efficiently.

Our first requisition was opened on October 10, but so far, we’ve only received a handful of profiles, and just four interviews have been scheduled. I’ve noticed a recurring pattern where, when we follow up for profiles, you often assure us that resumes will be sent by EOD. However, this commitment is frequently not met, which is concerning.

If you’re facing challenges, such as being overloaded or struggling to source profiles, I encourage you to escalate this to your manager or let me know. I’m happy to involve my manager to explore options for better managing the situation.

Delays in recruitment have already caused setbacks, including requisitions being canceled. We want to avoid similar issues in the future, especially given the unpredictable nature of approvals within the firm.

I kindly request that you prioritize sourcing profiles and scheduling interviews as promptly as possible. Your attention and proactive effort in this matter would be greatly appreciated.
