I was expecting an email from you regarding Chetan's onboarding and introduction, as today was supposed to be his first day. However, I haven't received any email, nor have I seen Chetan today. Could you clarify the situation?


Hi Scot,

As we discussed, the GenAI use case registration process requires a designated sponsor for this project. The sponsor can be either a technology manager or a business head associated with our KJHDUH unit. Their role would be to provide oversight, ensure alignment with business objectives, and facilitate approvals throughout the process.

To help with the decision-making, I have summarized the key aspects of the project and the proposal below. Additionally, a detailed project description, including objectives, implementation approach, expected benefits, and technical details, is provided in the attached document.

Please review the information, and let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification. Looking forward to your thoughts on the next steps.






As discussed, please proceed with rolling out the offer to Genny for the VP position. If she accepts, we should aim to onboard her within two weeks. Please keep us updated on the outcome.

Gine mentioned that Dave's role will be hired in Canada. As you know, we have been interviewing candidates for the RTCS/Architecture role. During this process, we have identified a few candidates who we believe would be a great fit for the App Lead position.

Attached is the profile of one such candidate for your review. Once the job is posted in Workday, please proceed with discussions with this candidate.

Let me know if you need any additional information.


The solution includes a feature-rich dashboard built with ReactJS, seamlessly integrated with the CitiVelocity platform and a comprehensive Grafana setup powered by CORTEX, TEMPO, and S3. It enables real-time monitoring of microservices deployed across various clusters and allows remote diagnostics of microservices through pre-built endpoints.

The candidate struggled to provide clear and satisfactory answers to the questions, including explaining project details or the rationale behind specific design and implementation choices. Despite the questions being based on the candidate's CV, she was unable to effectively articulate the concepts or skills listed. Java and microservices expertise appeared to be weak. Therefore, we are unable to move forward with this candidate.


Do we know who can approve this job requisition from the CCMP team? Please assist in expediting the process, as we’ve observed that most requisitions are being force-closed.

You've had a remarkable career journey in the Middle Office space. Your polite demeanor and calm, composed nature have made you a wonderful colleague to work with. Wishing you the very best as you embark on this new chapter. Good luck and all the best!


Please be reminded that this SN may not be implemented today due to delays in responding to emails and a lack of prompt and collective questioning by your team. Kindly improve the quality of asking questions promptly to avoid such scenarios in the future.



Hi Rthh,

I came across the email below from the TGG team, instructing users to migrate deployment descriptors from DeploymentConfig to Deployment. As you may recall from our previous meeting, the MO E&A team has developed an automated solution for this migration using a simple curl command.

I have CC’d you in the announcement email I sent in September 2024, and I’ve attached it here for reference. Could you please review it and help promote this solution among your users to ensure broader adoption?

Thanks!



The DDE Dashboard serves as the UI layer for visualizing events from the DDE-HUB. It provides a unified view for monitoring microservices running across clusters. Additionally, it includes a module that enables application teams to interact with pods running on different clusters.


A deployable agent component designed to execute commands from the Autosys server. It comes with pre-built scripts to start and stop pods and manage processes running on different pods.

The Job Server is a type of Tron microservice that can be extended to implement processes (jobs) invoked by the Job Agent. Logs generated by these processes are automatically transferred to the Job Agent, enabling them to be viewed in the Autosys UI.



Hi Saurabh,

As mentioned earlier, we won’t be moving forward with Govind since he didn’t show much engagement during the interview. Additionally, none of the candidates I interviewed demonstrated strong technical skills. Most were either moderate or below average. Given that the role requires someone without a local team who will primarily communicate over calls, being proactive and articulate is essential. Unfortunately, a moderate skill set combined with a lack of expressiveness is not something we can compromise on.


The process has been ongoing since October 2024, and we are seeking a candidate with 6-8 years of experience. We've already explored external options, but there's no guarantee that even if someone is selected, they will actually join. Continuing down that path would likely just be a waste of time.



The idea emerged when teams sought to transition to a microservice architecture while maintaining their existing client interfaces, such as GRPC, REST, JMS, and EMAIL. We developed support for all these interfaces on top of Ambrosia, allowing teams to integrate Ambrosia services into their existing systems and interact seamlessly through Service APIs.
