In the past two years, Saji has made remarkable strides in his role as Engineering Lead. He transformed the microservices landscape by implementing a no/low-code framework, accelerating development processes. Saji introduced reusable cloud components, such as job agents, ITRS, and Tron hub, significantly reducing the need for application teams to manage these components. He also pioneered the creation of comprehensive dashboards for microservices monitoring and administration across clusters. As the architect of the RTCS FX low-latency library, Saji delivered sub-millisecond performance, a foundational solution for RTCS. His leadership extended to projects like OneConfirms, PRIMO, and RTCS applications, while also addressing end-of-life technology risks through the TRON solution. Additionally, he championed Ambrosia in the MO space and contributed valuable insights on telemetry development, cementing his role as a technology leader

During his tenure at Citi, he managed several critical Middle Office business applications interfacing with Front Office systems that handle EQ Cash and Derivative products. He has extensive knowledge of the trade life cycle and middle office functions, including trade netting, allocation matching, confirmation generation, trade creation, client profiling, and charge calculations. He served as the application manager for CPACS, a global configuration service crucial to Front Office systems, where he handled charge calculations for EQ products. His strong support and timely, high-quality delivery earned him recognition from Middle Office operations and senior management.

Additionally, he was the lead developer for the CDSD application, a prestigious platform built using Ambrosia. He single-handedly delivered the shortsell locates module, working not only as a developer but also closely with the business to meet new functionality requirements. He successfully eliminated the legacy application and migrated all clients to the new platform, streamlining operations and improving system efficiency.

Saji is a highly hands-on technical leader with extensive contributions, making over 1,000 commits to Bitbucket in 2023 and 700+ in 2024. As an engineering lead, he collaborates closely with teams such as Ambrosia, TenantOps, DevOps, and ITRS, providing critical feedback to improve the quality and performance of their products and services. Saji is the author and maintainer of the TRON Stack Solution, an innovative framework designed to streamline cloud service development and address observability and monitoring requirements with a no-code approach. This solution includes centralized dashboards for managing microservices on OpenShift clusters and integrates OpenTelemetry for performance and trace metrics, feeding into a unified Grafana platform.

Additionally, he played a pivotal role in delivering sub-millisecond performance with the RTCS FX low-latency library and contributed to key projects like OneConfirms, PRIMO, and RTCS applications. Saji also championed Ambrosia in the Middle Office space, contributing to telemetry development and resolving critical end-of-life technology challenges, establishing himself as a technology leader.
