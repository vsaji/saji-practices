I'm quite disappointed that, despite having an approved position, we have been unable to create a job ad on Workday for the past two months due to a system error, with no resolution in sight. As you know, getting a position approved these days is already a challenge, and this system issue is now further delaying our hiring process.

Itâ€™s also concerning that your team has not been involved in addressing or resolving this issue. Since no assistance has been offered, we are left with no choice but to cancel and recreate the position, which will unfortunately cause further delays in hiring.

I urge you to please look into this matter and offer the necessary support to prevent further setbacks.
