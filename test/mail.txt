We've noticed an excessive amount of single trace data coming from your trading service in production. Please suppress these, as we've determined that this particular trace point is neither critical nor relevant to your application. Publishing single trace points doesn't add value and could unnecessarily consume space, potentially affecting performance.


I'm quite disappointed that, despite having an approved position, we have been unable to create a job ad on Workday for the past two months due to a system error, with no resolution in sight. As you know, getting a position approved these days is already a challenge, and this system issue is now further delaying our hiring process.

It’s also concerning that your team has not been involved in addressing or resolving this issue. Since no assistance has been offered, we are left with no choice but to cancel and recreate the position, which will unfortunately cause further delays in hiring.
I urge you to please look into this matter and offer the necessary support to prevent further setbacks.


Adrien joined our team in July 2024. He was provided with sessions on team roles and responsibilities, but we noticed a lack of punctuality and attendance in some of these sessions. He has also shown difficulty in understanding the project requirements, which has resulted in missed deadlines. Additionally, he has not been proactive in seeking clarification when needed.

Adrien joined our team in July 2024 and was given sessions on team roles and responsibilities. However, we have observed some challenges with his punctuality and attendance in these sessions. He has also encountered difficulties in grasping the project requirements, which has led to some missed deadlines. Furthermore, he could benefit from being more proactive in seeking clarification when necessary.

Adrien has been working on a few JIRAs since July 2024 and required some intensive support to keep the delivery process moving. It was also noted that an additional two-week buffer should be added to future delivery timelines, beyond the initial deadline.

His level of engagement has been noticeably lower compared to other second-year graduates. We've observed on multiple occasions that he remains online on Teams but often doesn't respond. He also shows a lack of initiative in fully understanding tasks, and during status calls, we frequently have to ask questions to uncover that he is unclear about certain concepts or requirements.

Additionally, he seems to need more encouragement to fully understand tasks. During status calls, we often find ourselves asking questions to clarify certain concepts or requirements he may not be entirely comfortable with.


Adrien is capable of delivering Java-based projects with some assistance. As a beginner, he lacks exposure to many of the technologies currently in use but is working to catch up. Given the team's extensive stack of tools and frameworks, he will need to put in extra effort to fully understand and familiarize himself with them.

He communicates effectively.
He acknowledges his areas for improvement.
He is willing to work on enhancing the skills where he falls short.

Requires detailed guidance to understand tasks.
Shows limited initiative in researching more efficient solutions.
Hesitant to engage in proactive conversations or suggest ideas.



Hi James,

The TRON Architecture has standardized our development and deployment model to centralize nearly all common configurations and implementations, including the startup script within a base Docker image. Since TRON services are designed to run on the cloud, we opted for Boot JAR packaging to simplify service deployment.

For this specific case, I aimed to find the simplest approach to achieve our objectives. We ultimately decided to use the export/options solution, which confines changes to the Docker image level, requiring no additional work from our clients.

Best regards,


I had the opportunity to meet with the candidate for the first round of discussions today. After our conversation, I believe it may be best not to proceed further with this candidate.

While he possesses the foundational knowledge we were seeking, I noticed some challenges in his comprehension of certain questions and concepts. Given the communication-intensive nature of this role, I feel this might pose some difficulties for him moving forward.



Denny joined the Engineering & Architecture (E&A) team in July 2024 as part of the second-year graduate program.

Observations:

Task Management and Independence
Throughout his tenure, Denny has shown a need for more guidance in executing tasks independently. His assignments frequently require continuous reminders and follow-ups to ensure progress. This is evident in multiple JIRA tickets assigned to him, where he has not been proactive in identifying risks or alerting the team about potential delays. Timely communication around these aspects is essential to maintain project momentum and ensure successful outcomes.

Communication and Availability
Another area of concern is Denny's Microsoft Teams status, which often indicates availability but does not accurately reflect responsiveness. This has led to occasional delays in communication, affecting the efficiency of collaborative efforts within the team.

Creative Thinking and Initiative
Denny’s approach to task execution has been predominantly task-oriented, lacking in creative thinking and initiative. There has been limited evidence of him proposing new ideas, initiating relevant discussions, or managing tasks collaboratively. Additionally, he has not proactively shared thoughts on potential solutions for issues encountered. A more active, innovative, and collaborative approach would benefit both his development and the team’s overall productivity.

Recommendations for Improvement:

Proactive Task Management: Denny would benefit from developing a more proactive approach in managing tasks and communicating risks or delays in a timely manner.
Accurate Status Reflection: Adjusting his Teams status to reflect actual availability and responding in a timely manner would improve team coordination.
Encouraging Innovation and Collaboration: Embracing a more creative and collaborative mindset could significantly enhance his contributions. Regularly proposing ideas, sharing insights, and initiating discussions could be beneficial for both Denny’s growth and team dynamics.


Denny demonstrates a polite and calm demeanor in the workplace. He is receptive to feedback and readily acknowledges areas for improvement when they are pointed out. However, there is a general observation that while he understands and accepts feedback, the follow-through on implementing it and showing consistent improvement in his behavior tends to be slow or, at times, lacking.



Hi Mic,

I lead the Engineering & Architecture initiatives in the EQ MO space, where my responsibilities focus on enhancing application development standards and enabling robust monitoring and observability for over 300 applications. My manager, Scot Brady (Global Head of EQ MO), mentioned meeting you at the EE Tech Conference on October 21 and learning about Grafana Enterprise's offerings. I’d like to schedule a call to explore the latest developments in Grafana Enterprise and discuss how quickly we might onboard our applications.

Thank you!


Here are some key incidents and evidence collected during the 30-day observation period, highlighting instances where Denny repeatedly demonstrated inattentiveness and other deficiencies.


Denny does not consistently update JIRA with progress or close tasks upon completion. Despite multiple reminders, he has not adopted this practice. For example, as shown below, there is a task still marked as "open," even though it has already been completed.

I instructed Adrien to create a JIRA ticket before starting any task. For the items listed below, I specifically asked him on October 30 to create the JIRA entries, but he did not follow this instruction. After I questioned him on November 7, he created the tickets in bulk but, as usual, did not update their statuses, leaving all of them marked as "in progress."



Upon joining the team, I requested the Pune team to provide a knowledge transfer session to Denny. However, he didn’t attend the sessions consistently and wasn’t proactive in notifying us when he couldn’t join. Additionally, from the team members’ perspective, he seemed disengaged and inattentive to details during the sessions.
