We've noticed an excessive amount of single trace data coming from your trading service in production. Please suppress these, as we've determined that this particular trace point is neither critical nor relevant to your application. Publishing single trace points doesn't add value and could unnecessarily consume space, potentially affecting performance.


I'm quite disappointed that, despite having an approved position, we have been unable to create a job ad on Workday for the past two months due to a system error, with no resolution in sight. As you know, getting a position approved these days is already a challenge, and this system issue is now further delaying our hiring process.

Itâ€™s also concerning that your team has not been involved in addressing or resolving this issue. Since no assistance has been offered, we are left with no choice but to cancel and recreate the position, which will unfortunately cause further delays in hiring.

I urge you to please look into this matter and offer the necessary support to prevent further setbacks.
