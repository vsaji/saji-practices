Saji provided an overview of the architecture and features of various components of the Tron Stack Solutions, including the Microservice Builder, Health Check Notifiers, and the visualization of service statuses on the Tron Dashboard.
A detailed discussion was held on the TRON Telemetry Platform, during which Saji explained how the MO and Principle Internalizer applications have utilized the platform for capturing metrics and traces.
It was identified that the PI integration can serve as a reference for implementing OT-LMS.
Puneet will collaborate with Saji to gather the necessary details and understand the solution for implementation.


The requirement is to utilize the Ambrosia ITRS service to route events from other services to ITRS Geneious.
Abhijit attempted to configure this setup, but the system failed to recognize the netprobe instance running on the cluster.
Saji reviewed the setup and recommended configuring separate netprobe instances for the primary and secondary POD instances.
Saji also identified an issue with the service name being used and advised using the name specified in the ITRS POD configuration.


I wanted to bring to your attention a pressing concern regarding the backfill for Shrikant's position, which has now been vacant for nearly four months. Unfortunately, despite Dixie's efforts, we have not yet been able to identify a suitable candidate to fill this role.

I personally interviewed over eight candidates so far, but none of them have met the basic requirements outlined in our job description. Additionally, I have observed a noticeable decline in the frequency of interview schedules recently, which is adding to the delay.

Given the prolonged timeline, there is a growing risk that this position may be cancelled if we do not finalize a candidate by next week. This would undoubtedly impact the team's workload and deliverables.

I would appreciate it if we could explore additional measures to expedite this process, such as widening the talent pool, revisiting the JD to ensure alignment with market expectations, or seeking internal referrals.

Looking forward to your guidance on how we can address this situation effectively.

Hi Alex,

I’m Saji, managing the Engineering & Architecture stream within the EQ MO space, reporting to Guhan. I’m also a former Caerus lead developer. During a recent discussion with my manager, he suggested that I set up an informal call with you to talk about my career aspirations, areas where I excel, and my experience. Could you let me know a convenient time for the discussion?

Thanks!


Hi Allen, it was great talking to you. However, the intention of the call was different and unrelated to the Caerus role, which I wasn’t even aware of. I’d like to clarify this further, so I’ll set up a call with you on Monday to provide more background and context.
