Hi [Colleague's Name],

I just wanted to drop you a quick note to thank you for the kind mention in the stoplight segment of the newsletter! It was a pleasure being the first client to use your framework, and I'm glad to see how far it has come. Your work has made a significant impact on our projects, and I look forward to more collaborations in the future.

Thanks again for the recognition!

Best regards,


I would be glad to assist anyone interested in learning about the E3 program journey and how it can help transform their career
