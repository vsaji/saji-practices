Denny was assigned a task that involved following a few steps to lock certain library component versions. The instructions were provided during the start-of-day (SOD) call, and he acknowledged understanding them, as there were only four steps. The task required freezing three components; he successfully locked one, but missed a step that involved creating a tag for the remaining two components. When asked about this oversight, he responded that he simply forgot.
