Denny was assigned a task that involved following a few steps to lock certain library component versions. The instructions were provided during the start-of-day (SOD) call, and he acknowledged understanding them, as there were only four steps. The task required freezing three components; he successfully locked one, but missed a step that involved creating a tag for the remaining two components. When asked about this oversight, he responded that he simply forgot.

Denny was assigned a task involving modifications across multiple files to update library versions, adjust configuration parameters, and verify the presence of certain settings. Given the number of validation steps required, I suggested that Denny create an Excel sheet to document each validation rule he should check against each component upon completing the changes. I also requested that he send an email capturing these details for our records before beginning the task. However, he proceeded with the migration task without sending the email and made an error that could have been avoided if he had documented the validation rules. When questioned about it in the end-of-day (EOD) call, he stated he wasnâ€™t aware he needed to send the email. Additionally, he has yet to provide the Excel sheet confirming his validation of the migration task according to the instructions.
